[00:22.82] She's taken my time
[00:25.37] Convinced me she's fine
[00:29.20] But when she leaves
[00:32.25] I'm not so sure
[00:39.75] 
[00:33.55] It's always the same
[00:37.06] She's playing her game
[00:39.78] And when she goes
[00:42.28] I feel to blame
[00:49.78] 
[00:44.65] Why won't she say she needs me?
[00:49.78] I know she's not as strong as she seems
[01:09.28] 
[00:54.68] Why don't I see her cry for help?
[01:00.18] Why don't I feel her cry for help?
[01:05.13] Why don't I hear her cry for help?
[01:22.13] 
[01:24.03] I wandered around
[01:27.39] The streets of this town
[01:30.26] Trying to find sense in it all
[01:45.26] 
[01:34.73] The rain on my face
[01:38.78] It covers the trace
[01:42.32] Of all the tears
[01:46.17] I've had to waste
[01:54.67] 
[01:47.80] Why must we hide emotions?
[01:51.17] Why must we never break down and cry?
[02:09.67] 
[01:56.03] All that I need is to cry for help
[02:01.47] Somebody please hear me cry for help
[02:07.96] All I can do is cry for help
[02:21.96] 
[02:23.92] No need to feel ashamed
[02:30.89] Release the pain, and
[02:34.63] Cry for help
[02:40.63] 
[02:38.53] Cry for help is all I need
[02:41.47] All I need is a cry for help
[02:46.03] Cry for help is all I need
[02:51.54] All I need is a cry for help
[03:05.54] 
[02:58.64] Why must we hide emotions?
[03:04.34] Why can't we ever break down and cry?
[03:22.84] 
[03:08.40] All that I need is to cry for help
[03:13.10] I will be there when you cry for help
[03:18.70] Why don't I hear her cry for help?
[03:35.70] 
[03:27.77] All that I need is to cry for help
[03:32.77] Somebody please hear me cry for help
[03:38.24] All I can do is cry for help
[03:52.24] 
[03:46.34] All that I need is to cry for help
[03:50.94] I will be there when you cry for help
[03:55.82] Is it so hard to cry for help?
[04:10.82] 
[03:59.77] (Cry for help is all I need)
[04:00.58] (All I need is a cry for help)
[04:01.60] (Cry for help is all I need) No need to feel ashamed
[04:02.24] (All I need is a cry for help) Come on and release the pain
[04:02.51] (Cry for help is all I need) Put your trust in me
[04:03.07] (All I need is a cry for help) My love is gonna set you free
[04:03.46] (Cry for help is all I need)
[04:03.88] (All I need is a cry for help)
