She's taken my time
Convinced me she's fine
But when she leaves
I'm not so sure

It's always the same
She's playing her game
And when she goes
I feel to blame

Why won't she say she needs me?
I know she's not as strong as she seems

Why don't I see her cry for help?
Why don't I feel her cry for help?
Why don't I hear her cry for help?

I wandered around
The streets of this town
Trying to find sense in it all

The rain on my face
It covers the trace
Of all the tears
I've had to waste
Why must we hide emotions?
Why can't we ever break down and cry?

Why don't I see her cry for help?
Why don't I feel her cry for help?
Why don't I hear her cry for help?

No need to feel ashamed
Release the pain, and
Cry for help

Cry for help
Is all I need
All I need
Is a cry for help

Cry for help
Is all I need
All I need
Is a cry for help

Why must we hide emotions?
Why can't we ever break down and cry?

Why don't I see her cry for help?
Why don't I feel her cry for help?
Why don't I hear her cry for help?

Why don't I see her cry for help?
Why don't I feel her cry for help?
Why don't I hear her cry for help?
