She's taken my time
Convinced me she's fine
But when she leaves
I'm not so sure
It's always the same
She's playing her game
And when she goes
I feel to blame
Why won't she say
she needs me
I know she's not
as strong as she seems
Why don't I see her cry for help
Why don't I feel
her cry forhelp
Why don't I hear
her cry for help
<♪>
I wandered around
the streets of this town
trying to find sense of it all
The rain on my face
it covers the trace
of all the tears
I'd had towaste
Why must we hide emotions
Why must we never
break down and cry
All that I need
is to cry for help
Somebody please hear me
cry for help
All I can do
is cry for help
<♪>
No need to feel ashamed
Cry for help
Cry for help is all I need
All I need is a cry for help
Cry for help is all I need
All I need is a cry for help
Why must we hide emotions
Why can't we ever
break down and cry
All that I need
is to cry for help
I will be there
when you cry for help
Why don't I hear
her cry for help
All that I need
is to cry forhelp
Somebody please hear me
cry for help
All I can do is cry for help
All that I need
is to cry for help
I will be there
when you cry for help
Is it so hard to cry for help
